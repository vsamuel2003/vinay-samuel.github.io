I am a rising senior at Carnegie Mellon University, passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As I prepare for graduate studies in these fields, I've been fortunate to work with several distinguished advisors on cutting-edge projects.

Under the guidance of [Prof. Karthik Narasimhan](https://karthikncode.github.io) in the Princeton NLP Group, I led research on developing PersonaGym, the first evaluation framework for persona agents in Large Language Models (LLMs). This project has contributed significantly to our understanding of AI personalities and their interactions.

I also collaborated with [Prof. Cornelia Caragea](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~cornelia/) on ImplicitAVE, the first open-sourced dataset for implicit attribution value extraction. Our work was accepted to ACL Findings 2024, marking a significant advancement in the field of natural language understanding.

Currently, I'm working with [Prof. Daphne Ippolito](https://www.daphnei.com) on LLM output control, exploring ways to enhance the reliability and consistency of AI-generated content.

These diverse experiences have solidified my commitment to pushing the boundaries of NLP and AI, and I'm excited to continue this journey in my graduate studies and beyond.
