I am an incoming first-year CS masters student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I received my BS in Statistics and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University where I graduated with University Honors. My current research experiences lie in LLM agents however I hope to explore other domains throughout my masters to further hone in on my research interests. In my undergraduate years I have been fortunate to work with several distinguished advisors on cutting-edge projects.

Under the guidance of [Prof. Karthik Narasimhan's](https://karthikncode.github.io) at the Princeton NLP Group, I led research on PersonaGym, the first evaluation framework for persona agents in Large Language Models. With [Prof. Cornelia Caragea](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~cornelia/), I developed ImplicitAVE, the first open-sourced dataset for implicit attribution value extraction, which was accepted to ACL Findings 2024. I worked with [Prof. Daphne Ippolito](https://www.daphnei.com) on LLM output control to control for resonse length of instruction-tuned models. Additionally, I collaborated with [Yijia Zhou](https://cs.stanford.edu/~shaoyj/) and [Prof. Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) on a framework for evaluating Human-AI collaboration between users and Language Model agents across multiple tasks.

I am always looking to collaborate on projects and can be reached at [vsamuel@umd.edu](vsamuel@umd.edu)
